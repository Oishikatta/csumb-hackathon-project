There are many options for struggling students to get more income, they have benifits and drawbacks. There are 3 kinds of loan one can apply for as a student. 

1.) Federal

	If your going to take out a loan, a federal loan may seem like your best option. You can take out up to $5,500 a year, and it had a fixed annual interest rate of 5%. However your college of choice will be your lender, so when it comes to paying back your loan, they will get to choose your timeline, and that could be good or bad dependant on your college. 
	
2.) Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Loans

	This most likely will be your best loan option. You can take out up to $8,500 and are given a fixed 3.4% interest rate, and the Department of Education will pay the interest on the loan as long as your in school half time. There is even a defferment period after graduation in which you won't have to pay interest.
	
3.) Direct Stafford Subsidized Loans: 

	If you need fast cash, and a lot of it, this is your best option. You can take out up to 20,500 however there is a interest rate of 6.8% which is a variable rate, so the rate may be lower, but likely, it'll be higher. The danger with these loans is that you must pay the interest the day the loan is dispursed so over the course of 8 years that interest can be extreamly damaging, especially if you choose to take out the max amount. 
	
Loans require extream responsability as you CAN NEVER DEFAULT ON A STUDENT LOAN! This means the follow you FOREVER. You will never be able to buy a home, or even a car with delinquent loan debt. It can ruin your credit making it impossible to rent anywhere, and if you choose to be delinquient and continue living in the state they will take any tax refund you ever get until the loans are paid.
