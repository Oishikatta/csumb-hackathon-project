There are many reasons to go to college, and according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a person with a bachelor's degree can earn as much as a $1 million more over a lifetime than someone with just a high school diploma. Going to college not only educates you, but also advances your opportunities for greater pay, and better jobs.
