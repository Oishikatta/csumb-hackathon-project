Community college is the cheapest option for school it seems. HOWEVER usually classes are impacted and it may take up to 4 years to get an AA in some subjects so for a lot of people going straight to a 4 year state, or university would have been a better option. If you have a plan community college may be your best option, its just important to check with your local colleges to make sure your classes aren't impacted.
