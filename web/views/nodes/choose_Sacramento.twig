Why choose Sacramento State?



Sacramento State, affectionately called Sac State, is an outstanding and affordable comprehensive university just a few miles from California's Capitol. 

Classrooms, labs, offices, and other facilities are nestled in a 3,500-tree urban forest alongside the American River. In addition to the bustling University life, all that Sacramento has to offer is moments away.

Our exceptional faculty is dedicated to student success, with one professor for every 27 students and an average of 34 students in each classroom. Sac State's legacy is its proud alumni, who make up the heart of the region's workforce and some of its finest leaders. For more information check out their website!
