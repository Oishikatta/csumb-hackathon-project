Why choose Monteray State?

There are few locations more compelling to earn your degree or certificate than in the Monterey Bay Area of California. Our main campus is in Aptos, a small beach community near the center of Santa Cruz County.

Residents enjoy a Mediterranean climate amid redwood forests, sparkling beaches and rich farmland. Local cultural highlights include performing arts events, museums and galleries that showcase the work of artists in every medium. Annual events celebrate the areaâ€™s ethnic and cultural diversity, and our agricultural roots are honored weekly on campus at our Saturday morning Cabrillo Farmers Market.
